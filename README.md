### What is Project Euler?

Project Euler is a series of challenging mathematical/computer programming problems that will require more than just mathematical insights to solve. Although mathematics will help you arrive at elegant and efficient methods, the use of a computer and programming skills will be required to solve most problems.

The motivation for starting Project Euler, and its continuation, is to provide a platform for the inquiring mind to delve into unfamiliar areas and learn new concepts in a fun and recreational context.

### Why did I decide taking this challenge?

I want to improve my logic and problem solving skills, plus this repository may help someone who gets stuck in any exercise. The main objective is to solve everything and have them in the different programming languages that I master.
